## What is 1337?
<a href="https://1337.ma/en/">1337</a> is a coding school in Morocco, free of charge, open and accessible to anyone between the ages of 18 and 30. No need for an IT degree, or of having undergone extensive IT training, it is a part of a big network called <a href="https://42.fr/en/network-42/">42</a> 
The teaching concept in this school is based on the principle of peer learning. This means that students primarily learn skills from each other and take responsibility for their own progress. And the college offers perfect conditions for them to do so. It’s open round the clock, has no timetable or text books, staff instead of teachers, clusters instead of classrooms.
## Conditions
The only condition that is set. For the current admissions period, each candidate must be between 18 and 30 years old (inclusive) on November 1st of the year of their admission.
If you are underage, you can take the admissions and Pool tests if you are in your senior year in high school; this is the only exception to the rule.

## How to study in 1337?
To join 1337, there are mainly 3 steps:

### Online test
Your admission to 1337 starts with an online test in the website <a href="candidature.1337.ma">candidature.1337.ma</a>. Register with your email address and follow the procedure using a desktop computer that is updated on a regular basis.
You will undergo logic and memory tests to ensure that you have the required capabilities to join the school.

### Check-in
The real game starts here because a lot of people want to join the school, yet nobody knows when they will announce the Check-in dates, so you can keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/1337FIL?s=20&t=ytO_gHvdmGEYGXazFRGD3g">@1337FIL</a> Twitter to know when the check-in is announced. and you have to be as fast as you can to get a place. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait until another check-in!<br> 
if you got you're place, you’ll receive an email about the date you chose to visit the school, and then at that date, you should come check-in at the premises of 1337(with your ID and the invitation), it is a key step that no one can do on your behalf.there you'll meet some staff who will present the school for you and answer all the questions you have.

### The pool (Piscine)
As in the check-in you have to be fast, in order to get a place in the pool too.<br>
The Pool is a 4-week immersion in the coding world, it starts from scratch, whatever your entry level is.<br>
In order to let you have an unforgettable experience at 1337, I will not spoil you, so as a general idea,
From Monday to Thursday you'll have to do your assignments(Days) as you learn with your peers, and each Friday you'll do an exam related to what you studied during the week, and then at the weekend, you can do some extra projects either in a group(Rush) or alone to boost your level and your knowledge.

## FAQ
<h3>1. why this weird name?</h3>
the name came from “leet speak” which is an informal language used on the internet, this language replaces letters with numbers and therefore:
For 13 37… there is nothing simpler: L=1, E=3, T=7.<br>
<h3>2. Where is the school located?</h3>
currently, there are 3 campuses of 1337, located in Khouribga, Ben Guerir and Tetouan. all three campuses are with the same equipments and spirit.<br>
<h3>3. Do you get a diploma?</h3>
NO, you don’t get a diploma but instead you get an international certificate “Certificate of an architect in digital technologies” delivered by 42.<br>
<h3>4. Are dorms and restaurant included?</h3>
for the restaurent, you get 2 meals per day (3 during the piscine).<br>
and for the dorms, the only ones who are getting them currently are the girls in Ben Guerir, otherwise you’ll have to find rent.<br>
<h3>5. What about the scholarship?</h3>
the answer is yes, there is a scholarship but with conditions.

## Note
If you're really fascinated by IT, then this school is definitely for you, but please don’t apply just because of the benefits, because trust me, you're going to have a hard time...
<br>In the end enjoy every line of code, and most importantly <strong>`DON'T COPY, AND LEARN!!!`</strong>, I shared my experience in the piscine not so you can copy the code, but to have an idea and to share my journey with you, and even if you did cheat, be sure that the staff will get you're ass for a re-code session.
<br>code with ♥, and good luck in your piscine.<br>
=)
